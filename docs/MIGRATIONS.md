# Reversible release migrations

Make every release schema change **apply forward and roll back** with a
checksummed ledger, without requiring production secrets to rehearse.

This complements [`docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md`](./RELEASE_READINESS.md) (when
present) and the deployment rollback rehearsal: migrations cover the Postgres
projection schema; rollback rehearsal covers contract ids / feature flags.

---

## Why this exists

`lib/db.ts` still bootstraps tables with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` via
`ensureSchema`. That path is not reversible. Release work needs an explicit
up/down chain so operators can:

- Rehearse a migration from a clean checkout (CI / contributor laptop).
- Roll back the latest *reversible* release migration if a deploy fails.
- Detect rewritten history via checksum mismatch (fail-closed).
- Keep irreversible baselines (ledger + base platform marker) blocked unless
  an operator passes `--force-destructive`.

---

## Quick start (no secrets)

By default the runner uses the in-memory fixture store (`lib/migrations/memory-store.ts`).
Nothing reads `DATABASE_URL` unless you opt in with `--live`.

```bash
# Show registered vs applied (fixture store).
npm run migrate:status

# Apply all pending migrations in memory.
npm run migrate:up

# Revert the latest reversible migration (v3 today).
npm run migrate:down

# Full verify: registry checks + up → down(reversible) → up cycle.
npm run migrate:verify
```

All of the above default to `--fixture` (in-memory). They exit `0` on success
and `1 ` on checksum / step failure. Nothing reads `DATABASE_URL` in fixture
mode.

---

## Live mode (Postgres)

Pass `--live` to apply migrations to a real Postgres database. This selects the
reviewed `PostgresMigrationStore` and requires `DATABASE_URL` to be set.

```bash
# Show status against the live database.
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db" npm run migrate:status -- --live

# Apply pending migrations.
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db" npm run migrate:up -- --live

# Revert the latest reversible migration.
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db" npm run migrate:down -- --live
```

If `--live` is passed without `DATABASE_URL`, the runner exits non-zero with a
message telling you to set it (or drop `--live`). `--fixture` is the default and
always wins if both flags are present.

### What the Postgres store does

- Maintains the `schema_migrations` ledger (`version`,
  `id`, `checksum`, `applied_at`).
- Computes checksums via `lib/migrations/checksum.ts` and compares them to
  the ledger before applying anything.
- Takes a session-level advisory lock (`ha...` key derived from the ledger
  table name) for the duration of a run, so concurrent runners block instead of
  interleaving.
- Runs each migration in its own transaction and writes the ledger row in the
  same transaction, so a mid-migration error leaves the prior state intact.

### Local Postgres for testing

You can run a throw-away Postgres in Docker to exercise the live path:

```bash
docker run --rm -d name migrations-pg \
  -e 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres' \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:16

DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres" \
  npm run migrate:up -- --live

# Running again is a no-op.
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres" \
  npm run migrate:up -- --live

docker stop migrations-pg
```

The unit tests in `tests/node/migrations.test.ts` use a fake pool to assert
the SQL sequence (lock → checksum compare → transaction → commit), so the Docker
step is optional and not required in CI.

## How it works

```
registry (lib/migrations/registry.ts)
    ↓
runner plan (up ascending / down descending)
    ↓
MigrationStore transaction (MemoryMigrationStore in fixture mode,
                               PostgresMigrationStore in live mode)
    ↓
schema_migrations ledger row written or removed
```

| Version | Id | Reversible? | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `001_schema_migrations_ledger` | No (destructive escape hatch) | Creates the ledger table |
| 2 | `base-platform-schema-v2` | No (destructive escape hatch) | Aligns with the existing `lib/db.ts` marker |
| 3 | `003_release_migration_events` | **Yes** | Audit table for release up/down events |

---

## Adding a release migration

1. Append a new object to `MIGRATIONS` in `lib/migrations/registry.ts`.
2. Give it the next integer `version`, a stable `id`, and a short `description`.
3. Write `up` SQL that is safe to run once (prefer `IF NOT EXISTS` / guarded DDL).
4. Write `down` SQL that undoes `up` exactly. If that is impossible without
   data loss, set `irreversible: true` and an `irreversibleReason`.
5. Never embed secrets, connection strings, or live credentials in SQL.
6. Add / extend tests in `tests/node/migrations.test.ts`.
7. Run `npm run migrate:verify` and `npm run test:smoke`.

Do **not** edit SQL for a version that may already be applied in any
environment — add a new version instead. Checksum mismatches fail closed.

---

## Failure behaviour

| Condition | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Reversible migration with empty `down` | Registry / apply refused |
| Checksum mismatch vs ledger | Status + migrate refuse |
| Down on irreversible without flag | Step fails with actionable message |
| Transaction error mid-up | Ledger row not recorded; prior state kept |
| Concurrent runners | Second runner blocks on the advisory lock |
| Secrets in error text | Redacted before surfacing |

---

## Relation to `lib/db.ts`

`ensureSchema` remains the bootstrapping path for application runtime. The
migration runner is the **release control plane**: it records versions, proves
reversibility for new changes, and blocks unsafe downs. Version `2` matches the
existing `base-platform-schema-v2` ledger seed so both stay aligned.
Moving the `ensureSchema` SQL into migrations is a separate follow-up.

---

## Operational impact

- **Release:** run `npm run migrate:verify` in CI / pre-release; treat failures
  as a hard gate for schema-changing releases. For the live database, run
  `npm run migrate:up -- --live` with `DATABASE_URL` configured.
- **Rollback:** `npm run migrate:down -- --live` reverts the latest reversible
  migration only. Baseline versions stay blocked on purpose.
- `**Secrets / env:** fixture mode never needs `DATABASE_URL`. Live mode reads it
  from the environment only. Do not paste connection strings into issues, PR
  bodies, or migration SQL.
